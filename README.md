## How to Contribute

### Hacktoberfest Dates:
- Create your Pull/Merge Requests (PR/MRs) between **October 1 and October 31** (any time zone).
- Contributions must be made to public, unarchived repositories.

### Quality Over Quantity:
- **No Spam**: Ensure your contributions are meaningful. Minor fixes like grammar updates are acceptable only if they add real value.
- PR/MRs should not have labels like “spam” or “invalid.” Contributions with the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label will be considered valid even if not merged immediately.

### Repository Participation:
- This repository encourages your contributions as part of Hacktoberfest!
- For your PR/MR to count toward your Hacktoberfest progress, it must be merged, receive an overall approving review, or be labeled “hacktoberfest-accepted.”

### Review Period:
- After creating a PR/MR, it will enter a **seven-day review period**. Ensure compliance throughout this time.
- PR/MRs still under review after October 31 may continue into November.

### Valid Contributions:
- We're looking for bug fixes, new features, and documentation improvements that add real value to the project.
